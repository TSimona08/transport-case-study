# Transport Case Study: Environmental Impacts of Private Transport in Denmark (2007-2040)

## Overview
This project analyzes the environmental impacts of private transport in Denmark from 2007 to 2040, with a focus on the transition from conventional vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs). The analysis includes EV market penetration modeling, emission calculations, and scenario-based sustainability assessments.
